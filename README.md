This is a demo of a configurable web-based dashboard that allows you 
a) select the columns of the data you want to display from the left hand sidebar 
b) add filters to the displayed data 
c) Save and export the dashboard column + filter config as a json.

## Build instructions
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This is a 3 hr weekend build. If I get a moment, I'll add data import functionality and data viz features so that it can be generally usable.
